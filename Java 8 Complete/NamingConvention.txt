■ Java is strictly a case sensitive programming language means in Java Application there is a seperate recognition for lower case letters and Upper Case letters .

Example:If we declare a variable names as Number(Using Capital letter) and number(Using Small letter) then both are different or in memory there are two different varibles.

int number; !=  int Number;       // Different Variables

■ Naming Conventions are used to make Java programs more readable.It is important to use meaningful and unambiguous names comrised of Java letters.


public class helloWorld      //Here we use camelCase Name Convention for creating a class helloWorld
{
    public static void main(String []Args){
        System.out.println("Welcome to My Repository");
    }
}
