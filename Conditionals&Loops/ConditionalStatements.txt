Conditionals are used to execute a certain section	of	code only if some specific condition is fulfilled,and optionally execute other statements if the given condition is	false.The result of	given conditional expression must be either	true or	false.

Different variations of	this conditional statement are	–

• if statement

if statement evaluates the	given test expression.If it	is	evaluated to true,then statements	inside the if block	will be	executed.Otherwise,statements inside if	block is skipped.

Syntax
if(test_expression)	{
//	Statements	to	be	executed	only	when	
test_expression	is	true
}

Example Code:-

public static void main(String args[])
	{
     int n =5;
     if(n<10)
     {
      System.out.print("Inside if statement");
     }
      System.out.println("Outside if statement");
     }

Output:
Inside	if	statement
Outside	if	statement

So if the condition given inside if	parenthesis	is true, then statements inside	if block are	executed first and then rest of	the	code.And if	the	condition evaluates	to false,then statements inside if block will be skipped.	

• If– else	statement

if statement evaluates the given test expression.If	it is evaluated	to true,then statements	inside the if block	will be	executed.Otherwise,statements inside else block	will be	executed. After that,rest of the statements	will be	executed normally.

Syntax
if(test_expression)	{
     //	Statements to be executed when test_expression is true
}
else {
    //Statements to	be	executed when test_expression is false
}

Example	Code:

public static void main(String[]args)	
 {
     int a=10,b=20;
     if(a>b)
       {
       System.out.println("a is	bigger");
       }
    else
    {
     System.out.println("b is bigger");
    }
}

Output
b is bigger
