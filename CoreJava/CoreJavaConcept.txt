Keywords:Keyword is a reserved word that has a specific meaning within the programming language. Keywords cannot be used as identifiers for variables, classes, methods, or packages. There are 54 keywords in Java which can be categorized as follows:-

Primitive Data Types: Keywords like int, double, char, boolean, etc. represent the basic data types that can be used to store values in Java programs.

Control Flow Statements: Keywords like if, else, for, while, switch, break, continue, etc. control the flow of execution in a Java program.

Class Definition and Access: Keywords like class, interface, extends, implements, public, private, protected, static, final, etc. are used to define classes, interfaces, and their relationships.

Method Definition and Invocation: Keywords like void, return, this, new, etc. are used to define methods, their return types, and how objects are created and interacted with.

Special Keywords: Keywords like abstract, assert, const, default, enum, null, package, super, synchronized, transient, volatile, etc. serve specific purposes in the Java language.

Identifier:An identifier is a name given to a class, interface, method, variable, or package. It allows a programmer to refer to the item from other places in the program. Identifiers are used to give meaningful and descriptive names to programming elements, making the code more readable and understandable.

Rules for Creating Valid Identifiers:

=>First Character: The first character must be a letter, an underscore (_), or a dollar sign (<span class="math-inline">\).

=>Subsequent Characters: Subsequent characters can be letters, digits, underscores (`_`), or dollar signs (`).

=>Case Sensitivity: Java identifiers are case-sensitive. For example, message and Message are considered different identifiers.

=>Keywords: Identifiers cannot be keywords. Keywords are reserved words with specific meanings in the Java language.

=>Length: There is no maximum length for identifiers, but it is recommended to use meaningful and concise names.

Examples of Valid Identifiers:

name
age
studentID
calculateAverage
_phoneNumber

Examples of Invalid Identifiers:

123 (starts with a digit)
@username (contains an invalid character)
if (keyword)
class (keyword)
