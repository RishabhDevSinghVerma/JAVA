About Java

Java was developed by sun microsystem in 1991,later acquired by oracle corporation.It was developed by james gosling,patrick Naughton and mike sheridan and its team called Green team.
Java is object-oriented, general purpose programming,robust (Capacity of a computer system to handle the errors during execution and manage the incorrect input of data),platform independent programming language used to create application software such as desktop application.

Keywords:Keyword is a reserved word that has a specific meaning within the programming language. Keywords cannot be used as identifiers for variables, classes, methods, or packages. There are 54 keywords in Java which can be categorized as follows:-

Primitive Data Types: Keywords like int, double, char, boolean, etc. represent the basic data types that can be used to store values in Java programs.

Control Flow Statements: Keywords like if, else, for, while, switch, break, continue, etc. control the flow of execution in a Java program.

Class Definition and Access: Keywords like class, interface, extends, implements, public, private, protected, static, final, etc. are used to define classes, interfaces, and their relationships.

Method Definition and Invocation: Keywords like void, return, this, new, etc. are used to define methods, their return types, and how objects are created and interacted with.

Special Keywords: Keywords like abstract, assert, const, default, enum, null, package, super, synchronized, transient, volatile, etc. serve specific purposes in the Java language.

Identifier:An identifier is a name given to a class, interface, method, variable, or package. It allows a programmer to refer to the item from other places in the program. Identifiers are used to give meaningful and descriptive names to programming elements, making the code more readable and understandable.

Rules for Creating Valid Identifiers:

=>First Character: The first character must be a letter, an underscore (_), or a dollar sign (<span class="math-inline">\).

=>Subsequent Characters: Subsequent characters can be letters, digits, underscores (`_`), or dollar signs (`).

=>Case Sensitivity: Java identifiers are case-sensitive. For example, message and Message are considered different identifiers.

=>Keywords: Identifiers cannot be keywords. Keywords are reserved words with specific meanings in the Java language.

=>Length: There is no maximum length for identifiers, but it is recommended to use meaningful and concise names.

Examples of Valid Identifiers:

name
age
studentID
calculateAverage
_phoneNumber

Examples of Invalid Identifiers:

123 (starts with a digit)
@username (contains an invalid character)
if (keyword)
class (keyword)

Variable: A variable is a container that holds data values while the program is executed. It is declared with a data type that determines the type of information it can store, such as integers, strings, or boolean values.

Types of Variables in Java:

Local Variables: These variables are declared within a method or block of code and exist only during the execution of that method or block.

Instance Variables: These variables belong to an object and are declared within a class but outside of any method. They exist for the lifetime of the object.

Static Variables: These variables are also known as class variables. They are declared with the static keyword and belong to the class itself, not to individual objects. They exist for the entire program.

Datatypes:Data types in Java are the foundation for storing and manipulating data in Java programs. They categorize different types of information and define the range of values that a variable can hold.Java provides two primary types of data types:

Primitive Data Types:Primitive data types represent fundamental data elements that are directly supported by the Java language. They are not objects and are stored directly in memory. Java has eight primitive data types:

byte: An 8-bit signed integer, ranging from -128 to 127.

short: A 16-bit signed integer, ranging from -32768 to 32767.

int: A 32-bit signed integer, ranging from -2147483648 to 2147483647.

long: A 64-bit signed integer, ranging from -9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807.

float: A 32-bit single-precision floating-point number.

double: A 64-bit double-precision floating-point number.

boolean: A true/false value.

char: A 16-bit Unicode character.

Non-Primitive Data Types:Non-primitive data types are derived from primitive data types or other non-primitive data types. They represent more complex data structures and are created using keywords like class, interface, and array. Examples include:

String: A sequence of characters.

Arrays: An ordered collection of elements of the same data type.

Objects: Instances of classes that encapsulate data and behavior.

Interfaces: Abstract blueprints for defining the behavior of classes.
