Lets take an Example:-
When we solve math problem first we see the problem and understand the problem , after we think about the problem what process we need to do follow to solve the problem then we execute or solve the problem. 

Same steps are followed in flowchart so steps would be analyze the problem
                                     ______________________________________________________
                                    |                                                      |
   _____________             _______________              _______________             ____________
  | Analyze the |           |   Think of    |            |   Pen Down    |           |  Code the  |
  |   Problem   |---------->|   Solution    |----------->|  The Solution |---------->|  Solution  |
  |_____________|           |_______________|            |_______________|           |____________|

Solving the Problem in Computer actually we need to code But we should not jump to think of solution to code of soluton . Before going to code pen down the solution is most important part.

-Allows us to breakdown any process into smaller steps and display them in a visually pleasing way.

Flowchart Components:-

● Terminators

This symbol indicates Start, Stop and Halt in a program’s logic flow.
  ___________
 /           \
|    Start    |   Mainly Used to denote start point of the program
 \___________/


  ___________
 /           \
|    END      |  Used to denote end point of the program.
 \___________/


 ● Input/Output 

A parallelogram denotes any function of input/output type.
Program instructions that take input from input devices and display output on output devices are indicated with parallelogram in a flowchart. 

    _______________
   /              /
  /   Read Var   /      Used for taking input from the user and store it in variable ‘var’.
 /______________/
 
    _______________
   /              /
  /   Print Var  /     Used to output value stored in variable ‘var’.
 /______________/
 

 ● Process

A box represents arithmetic instructions. All arithmetic processes such as adding, subtracting, multiplication and division are indicated by action or process symbol. 

 _____________
|             |
|  Sum( 2,3)  |        Used to perform the operation(s) in the program. 
|_____________|        For example: Sum(2, 3) just performs arithmetic summation of the numbers 2 and 3.


 ● Decision

Diamond symbol represents a decision point. Decision based operations such as yes/no question or true/false are indicated by diamond in flowchart. 

           /\
          /  \
         /    \
        /      \
       /        \
      /          \
     /            \        Used to make decision(s) in the program means it depends on somecondition and answers in  
    /     Is N     \       the form of TRUE(for yes) and FALSE(for no).
    \ Greater than /
     \      M     /
      \          /
       \        /
        \      /
         \    /
          \  /
           \/


 ● Arrows

  Arrows represent the direction of flow of control and relationship among different symbols of flowchart. 
       
       |    ∧
       |    |
       |    |    Generally, used to show the flow of the program from one step to another.
       |    |    The head of the arrow shows the next step and the tail shows the previous one.
       v    |
  

● Connector 
   ___ 
  /   \     Used to connect different parts of the program and are used in case of
  \___/     break-through. Generally, used for functions.
